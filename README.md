# MiniProject - Jacob Schnitker


You can run this code in 2 ways:

1. 
Download all the files from the github and put them in a folder. Put that folder in your android studio projects folder and run it like you would normally.
I ran this app using a pixel 5 emulator running with API 33.
   
2. 
Do the same as above but dont run it in android studio. Go to the top and select build then select build APK. There should be an option in the process to go
to the folder location, but if you dont get that, it looks something similar to this: C:\Users\starm\AndroidStudioProjects\MiniProject\app\build\outputs\apk\debug. 
Once you're in that folder, find the APK and load it onto you android device. You can install it by finding the APK in your files and clicking it.
